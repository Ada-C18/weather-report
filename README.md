## Goal

"Do I need to bring a jacket?" "Will it snow today?" "How hot will it be?" When we have questions like these, we often pull open a weather app!

Great weather apps do these two things:

1. Pull weather data from a data source
1. Display the weather in readable, compelling way

Our goal is to create a fun, small weather app that focuses on displaying the weather.

Instead of getting weather data from a data source, we will set the weather using user interaction.

![Example weather app: The temperature reads 71, in orange text. The selected dropdown for "Sky" is "Cloudy." There is a depiction of cloudy weather. The city name is "My Hometown." The header reads "My Hometown."](ada-project-docs/assets/example-71.png)

![Example weather app: The temperature reads 98, in red text. The selected dropdown for "Sky" is "Sunny." There is a depiction of sunny weather. The city name is "it's hot outside." The header reads "it's hot outside."](ada-project-docs/assets/example-98.png)

![Example weather app: The temperature reads 32, in teal text. The selected dropdown for "Sky" is "Snowy." There is a depiction of snowy weather. The city name is "Happyville." The header reads "Happyville."](ada-project-docs/assets/example-32.png)

![Example weather app: The temperature reads 64, in yellow text. The selected dropdown for "Sky" is "Rainy." There is a depiction of rainy weather. The city name is "Seattle." The header reads "Seattle."](ada-project-docs/assets/example-64.png)
