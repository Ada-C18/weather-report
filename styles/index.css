/* - the temperature number changes color

/* 
Depending on what temperature it is, a different landscape should appear on the page.

These landscapes can be anything, as long as they are visual and noticeable to any instructors. For example, the landscapes can be:

- A single image that appears
- ASCII art
- Text

Changing landscapes should _replace_ the existing landscape. There should only be one visible landscape at a time.

There must be at least four landscapes.

Our solution uses the following ranges, which you may use if desired:

| Temperature (F) | Landscape                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 80+             | `"🌵__🐍_🦂_🌵🌵__🐍_🏜_🦂"`       |
| 70-79           | `"🌸🌿🌼__🌷🌻🌿_☘️🌱_🌻🌷"`      |
| 60-69           | `"🌾🌾_🍃_🪨__🛤_🌾🌾🌾_🍃"`        |
| 59 or below     | `"🌲🌲⛄️🌲⛄️🍂🌲🍁🌲🌲⛄️🍂🌲"` | */
