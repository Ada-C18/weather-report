## Wave 1: Create Wireframes

Before writing code, create a set of diagrams, sketches, or low-fidelity wireframes to visualize your project's layout.

These wireframes should include all the required HTML elements.

If possible, share and talk through ideas with someone else!

Use these wireframes to guide the rest of your project.

### Tips

- This project will require you to select _a lot_ of elements. Creating logical, well-organized HTML structures in the beginning will help you later on.
- Create as many `id`s as you need. Sometimes, it's more effective to select by ID, compared to selecting by class, element, or relationship.
